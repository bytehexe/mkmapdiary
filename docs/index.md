A travel journal generator that transforms your GPS tracks, notes, and photos into beautiful, interactive travel websites.

## What is mkmapdiary?

Mkmapdiary is a Python tool that automatically creates travel journals from your raw travel data. Whether you're documenting a weekend hike, a cross-country road trip, or a multi-week adventure, mkmapdiary helps you turn your GPS tracks, photos, and notes into a web-based diary.

## Key Features

- **📍 GPS Track Visualization**: Interactive maps displaying your routes and points of interest
- **📝 Note Integration**: Combines your text notes and markdown files with location data
- **📸 Photo Gallery**: Automatically organizes and displays your travel photos
- **🎤 Audio Transcription**: Converts voice recordings into searchable text
- **🌐 Static Website Generation**: Creates fast, self-contained websites that work anywhere
- **📱 Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design that looks great on all devices
- **📦 No Server Required**: No need for webserver installation - share via ZIP file or USB stick

## Quick Start

Install mkmapdiary with all optional dependencies:

```bash
pipx install 'mkmapdiary[all]' --pip-args=--pre
```

`--pre` is needed for now: mkmapdiary has not published a stable release yet, so pip
would otherwise refuse to select a version.

Generate a travel journal from your data directory:

```bash
mkmapdiary build your_travel_data/
x-www-browser your_travel_data_dist/index.html
```
