  generate_title:
    prompt: |
      Create exactly one title that summarizes the following text in {locale}.
      The title must be a single phrase, 3â€“5 words long.
      Use only words or phrases, or concepts that appear in the text.
      If the text contains multiple topics, combine them in a single title, separated naturally (e.g., with commas or conjunctions).
      Focus on the most important topics if all cannot fit in the title.
      Do not produce multiple titles, or explanations.
      Do not include phrases like 'Here is' or 'Summary'.
      Do not invent information not present in the text.
      Output only the title, nothing else.
